                <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The purpose of Medico is to support individuals with chronic conditions that require regular medication intake and recurring medical appointments, such as diabetes, asthma, cardiovascular conditions, or long-term mental health treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
            People with chronic illnesses often take medications daily. Missing doses or appointments can have serious consequences. Although there are existing health-related applications, many of them tend to be too complex, overwhelming, or impersonal. Medico aims to be simple, friendly, intuitive, and supportive.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is why I opted for having a mascot whose goal is to interact with the user and share reminders related to medications and appointments. This design choice was made without taking away from the main purpose of the app. The mascot is not the central feature of the application, but rather a supporting element that helps make the experience feel less intimidating and overly serious.
        </p>
        <p>
            Often, people enjoy gamifying their daily tasks, and when something feels too serious or rigid, they may avoid it altogether. In the context of health, this avoidance can lead to demotivation and eventually to users abandoning the app. Medico aims to deliver real and useful help in a fun and encouraging manner, motivating users rather than making them feel like they are completing yet another boring or stressful task.
        </p>

                <h2>2. Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>
            Medico aims to support users in remembering their medications and managing their health routines. Managing multiple medications can easily become confusing and discouraging, which may lead users to stop keeping track altogether.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, many existing health applications lack a human and encouraging tone, which can make the experience feel cold or overwhelming. Medico aims to solve this problem by providing clear reminders while maintaining a friendly, supportive, and motivating approach.
        </p>

                <h2>3. Target Users</h2>
        <p>
            This application is designed to accompany users of different age groups in their daily lives by offering guidance and support.
        </p>
        <p>User groups include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Teenagers or adults with chronic illnesses</li>
            <li>Users who need to keep up with daily medications</li>
            <li>Users managing regular doctor appointments</li>
            <li>Older adults or busy students and professionals</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The app aims to be accessible to users who may not be very comfortable with technology and therefore require a simpler and clearer user interface. Medico provides the necessary features in the least confusing way possible, prioritizing clarity and ease of use.
        </p>

                <h2>4. User Research Methodology</h2>
        <p>
            In order to properly design the application, a user research survey was conducted to collect insights on how the application should be structured and which features would be most useful.
        </p>
        <p>
            An anonymous online survey lasting approximately 5–10 minutes was conducted using Google Forms. The survey targeted individuals living with chronic health conditions or those closely managing such conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://forms.gle/4YT36XMRDRWoSY7MA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://forms.gle/4YT36XMRDRWoSY7MA</a>

        <h2>4.1 Survey Design</h2>
        <p>The survey contained the following sections:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Background Information:</strong> Collects the user’s age range, health condition, and number of medications taken regularly.</li>
            <li><strong>Current Behavior:</strong> Explores how users currently remember their medications, how often they forget doses, and how they track doctor appointments.</li>
            <li><strong>User Needs:</strong> Identifies difficulties in managing medications, frustrations with current health apps, desired features, and the importance of tone, simplicity, and personalization.</li>
        </ul>

                <h2>4.2 Survey Results & Key Findings</h2>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, the survey did not receive a large number of responses, resulting in a limited sample size (the survey was shared on Instagram and Reddit). However, a few relevant trends were still observed.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Most respondents expressed the importance of having a personalized experience when using a health application. This directly supports Medico’s goal of personalization and the inclusion of a mascot to make the app feel more engaging and “alive.”</li>
            <li>When asked "What would make a medication reminder app truly helpful for you?", one respondent replied: "If it shows a yearly graph (improved health) — real metrics to keep track of improvement." This suggestion was not initially planned but was later incorporated into the wireframe designs.</li>
            <li>Users expressed a preference for relevant and precise notifications, specifically indicating which medication to take at the requested time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This also highlights that users do not appreciate being overwhelmed with notifications. Excessive notifications often lose their meaning or get ignored altogether. A simple and direct notification, containing only the necessary information and delivered at the right time, is far more effective.
        </p>

            <section>
                <h2>5. User Personas</h2>
        <p>
            Chronic health conditions vary greatly, and users therefore have diverse needs. Despite these differences, all users must be supported within a single application.
        </p>
        <p>
            Two personas were created based on responses collected from the survey. 
            Creating these personas helps keep user needs in mind throughout the design process and ensures that design decisions remain user-centered.
        </p>
        <p>
            The user needs and requirements captured by the personas are the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide clear medication reminders with notifications containing only relevant information</li>
            <li>Offer an easy and quick way for users to log their medication intake</li>
            <li>Maintain a friendly and encouraging tone without compromising the seriousness of the app’s purpose</li>
            <li>Ensure accessibility through readable fonts and a simple, intuitive interface</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Persona 1</strong> represents a younger user who is tech-savvy but struggles with consistency in medication intake due to a busy lifestyle. 
        </p>
        <img id="persona1" src="images/persona1.png" alt="Persona 1">
        <p>
            <strong>Persona 2</strong> represents an older adult who has a heavy schedule and requires a straightforward and easy-to-navigate application.

                <h2>6. User Journey Mapping</h2>
        <p>
            To properly proceed with the design of the application, various use cases were identified.  
            Two User journey Maps were created to visualize how the personas would interact with Medico throughout their daily routines.

            <section>
                <h2>7. Sketches</h2>
        <p>The design process began with simple sketches that outlined the overall structure and functionality of the app. These sketches included the following pages:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Welcome page</li>
            <li>Survey</li>
            <li>Login / Sign-up</li>
            <li>Home page</li>
            <li>Settings</li>
            <li>Medications page</li>
            <li>Appointments page</li>
            <li>Messaging page</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Originally, the mascot was designed as a leaf. 
        <img id="sketches1" src="images/sketches1.jpeg" alt="Sketches 1">
        <p>
            However, a pill was found to be more intuitive and directly related to the purpose of the application.
        </p>
        <img id="sketches2" src="images/sketches2.png" alt="Sketches 2">
        <p>
            The sketches were intentionally kept simple and rough to focus on the overall concept and structure of the app rather than on visual details. This approach allows for quick iterations and adjustments based on feedback before moving into more detailed designs.

                <h2>8. Wireframes</h2>
        <p>
            Once satisfied with the overall concept, low-fidelity wireframes were created. These wireframes helped define the layout and features of each page while keeping the design simple before moving into the high-fidelity UI/UX design phase in Figma.

        <p>
            A storyboard was created to illustrate how the application would be used in a real-life context. It captures one of the many possible scenarios in which Medico would support a user throughout their day.

                <h2>10. Design Phase</h2>
        <p>
            Designing an application involves multiple steps, one of which is finding visual inspiration.
        </p>

        <h3>10.1 The Mascot</h3>
        <p>
            The inspiration behind the mascot comes from personal experience with applications such as Duolingo. Duolingo’s mascot plays a major role in making the app engaging and memorable. While Medico does not aim to replicate Duolingo’s frequent notification style, the idea of a friendly mascot that encourages users was a strong source of inspiration.
        </p>

        <h3>10.2 Color Palette</h3>
        <p>
            Initially, an orange color palette was explored to create a warm and welcoming feeling. However, it quickly began to resemble a pet-related application. 
        </p>
        <img id="og-palette" src="images/original_palette.png" alt="Original Palette">
        <div class="color-palette">
            <div class="swatch dark" style="background:#673902;" title="#673902"><span class="swatch-label">#673902</span></div>
            <div class="swatch" style="background:#F28502;" title="#F28502"><span class="swatch-label">#F28502</span></div>
            <div class="swatch" style="background:#FFF4E7;" title="#FFF4E7"><span class="swatch-label dark-text">#FFF4E7</span></div>
            <div class="swatch" style="background:#FFFFFF;" title="#FFFFFF"><span class="swatch-label dark-text">#FFFFFF</span></div>
            <div class="swatch dark" style="background:#444444;" title="#444444"><span class="swatch-label">#444444</span></div>
        </div>
        <p>
           For this reason, a green color palette was chosen instead. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Green is commonly associated with health, balance, and calmness. It helps reinforce the app’s purpose while making users feel at ease.
        </p>

        <div class="color-palette">
            <div class="swatch" style="background:#96DE80;" title="#96DE80"><span class="swatch-label">#96DE80</span></div>
            <div class="swatch" style="background:#D7EBD2;" title="#D7EBD2"><span class="swatch-label dark-text">#D7EBD2</span></div>
            <div class="swatch" style="background:#FFFFFC;" title="#FFFFFC"><span class="swatch-label dark-text">#FFFFFC</span></div>
            <div class="swatch" style="background:#EEEDD9;" title="#EEEDD9"><span class="swatch-label dark-text">#EEEDD9</span></div>
            <div class="swatch dark" style="background:#3E3E3E;" title="#3E3E3E"><span class="swatch-label">#3E3E3E</span></div>
            <div class="swatch dark" style="background:#262626;" title="#262626"><span class="swatch-label">#262626</span></div>
        </div>

        <h3>10.3 Typography</h3>
        <p>
            Medico is meant to be intuitive, clear, and visually consistent. For this reason, a simple and readable font was chosen: Roboto. Roboto is commonly used on Android devices, is highly legible, and does not distract from the content.
        </p>
        <div class="typography-sample">
            <img src="images/roboto_sample.svg" alt="Roboto sample">
        </div>

        <h3>10.4 Icons and Illustrations</h3>
        <p>
            Icons were selected from Flaticon (<a href="https://www.flaticon.com " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.flaticon.com</a> ), 
            and used under their free license with attribution. I ensured that a consistent icon set was used throughout the application. Icons with thicker lines were chosen to match the visual style of the mascot that has thick bold lines.
        </p>

        <div class="icons-grid">
            <div class="icon-item"><img src="images/icons/home-black.png" alt="Home"></div>
            <div class="icon-item"><img src="images/icons/calendar-black.png" alt="Calendar"></div>
            <div class="icon-item"><img src="images/icons/capsules-black.png" alt="Capsules"></div>
            <div class="icon-item"><img src="images/icons/comment-black.png" alt="Comment"></div>
            <div class="icon-item"><img src="images/icons/settings-black.png" alt="Settings"></div>
            <div class="icon-item"><img src="images/icons/checkmark.png" alt="Checkmark"></div>
            <div class="icon-item"><img src="images/icons/pencil-green.png" alt="Pencil"></div>
            <div class="icon-item"><img src="images/icons/search-dark green.png" alt="Search"></div>
        </div>

        <p>
            The mascot was hand-drawn by myself using Resprite, a pixel art software. The design was kept minimalistic to avoid overwhelming users and lose the meaning it's supposed to convey which is friendliness and warmth.
        </p>

        <h3>10.5 Naming & Logo</h3>
        <p>
            The name of the app and the mascot were intentionally kept the same to reinforce brand recognition. The logo is simply the face of the mascot.
        </p>
        <img id="logo" src="images/logo.png" alt="Logo">
        <p>
            The name <strong>Medico</strong> was chosen because it is short, catchy, and directly related to health, without sounding overly serious or intimidating.

        <p>
            The application opens with a welcome page where the mascot, Medico, greets the user and briefly explains the app’s purpose.

            Once logged in, the user arrives on the home page, which presents a daily dashboard showing the scheduled medications for the day and an encouraging messages from Medico. The home page serves as a quick overview of the user’s daily health routine and provides motivation to stay on track.

            While Medico successfully addresses medication and appointment tracking, future iterations could explore caregiver integration and professional dashboards. Conducting surveys with healthcare professionals would provide valuable insight into their needs and expectations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Accessibility remains a core priority. Future improvements include dark mode, light mode, high-contrast mode, colorblind options, adjustable font sizes, and full screen reader compatibility.
